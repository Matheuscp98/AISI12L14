# AISI12L14
Dataset with 2,448 raw surface roughness measurements (Ra, Rq, Rt, Ry, Sm) from turning experiments on slender AISI 12L14 steel shafts. Based on a crossed DOE combining CCD (Vc, f, d) and nested GFFD noise factors (diameter, tool wear, position), preserving full hierarchical acquisition for reproducible analysis.
